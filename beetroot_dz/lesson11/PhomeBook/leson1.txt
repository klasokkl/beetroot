Build a simple Phonebook console app.
Functionality of application:
    Add new entries
    Search by first name
    Search by last name
    Search by full name
    Search by telephone number
    Search by city or country
    Delete a record for a given telephone number
    Update a record for a given telephone number
    An option to exit the program

This program should operate on the console. It should display all the choices of available commands
when the program loads.
This program should run until the user selects the exit option.

Key points:
all program logic should be split to different functions;
store all entries in the dict, where key is the phone number
and value another dict with {all other data};
